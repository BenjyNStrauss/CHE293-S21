vkabat.jar and entropy.jar are scripts designed to provide users with a simple way to get e6, e20, and vkbat values for each residue.

The output_to_csv.py script was written by Richard Pearson and is a tool to take the raw command line outputs and transfer them to a csv file.

The entropy.jar and vkbat.jar files were written by Benjy Strauss. This readme file was written by Richard Pearson and is
intended to provide a quick start up guide and provide users with some information on setup.

This document will cover setup first and then simple use instructions.

Note: This should work equally well on Windows, Mac, and Linux OS and on both 32-bit and 62-bit arch.
However, my install was successfully accomplished using a 64-bit Mac with High Sierra installed.

\\ Java
Most importantly, you will need Java installed on your computer.

To check if you have Java installed enter the following into the terminal window:
	java -version

This should return some basic information about which version of java is installed.

Now check to see if it is on your PATH by typing the following:
	which java


\\ Python
Python and Perl are both required to be installed and should be on your computer's PATH.

To check if you have Python enter the following into your terminal window:
	python --version
To check if you have Python on your PATH enter the following into your terminal window:
	which python

I used Python 3.8.3 which can be downloaded at python.org

\\ Python libraries
Two known python library dependencies are the libraries called biopython and pandas.

Check to see if your computer has the biopython and pandas library by entering the following into
your terminal window:

	pip list
	-or-
	conda list

A list will be returned and check to see if biopython is in this list. If it is not, type
the following into the command line:

	pip install biopython
	pip install pandas
	-or-
	conda install biopython
	conda install pandas


\\ Perl
To check if you have Perl enter the following into your terminal window:
	perl -v
To check if you have Perl on your PATH enter the following into your terminal window:
	which perl

I used Perl 5.28.0 which can be downloaded at perl.org

If you have a mac you can use the following to install perl:

	curl -L http://xrl.us/installperlosx | bash

\\ Perl modules
The known Perl module dependencies are the following, HTTP::Request and LWP::MediaTypes

To check this enter the following in the terminal:

	instmodsh

Then type l and hit ENTER.
Check to see if these are 

To install run the following commands:

	\curl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash

	cpan App::cpanminus

	cpanm HTTP::Request
	
	cpanm LWP::MediaTypes

ONLY INSTALL THESE PERL MODULES IF THE FOLLOWING TERMINAL COMMANDS DO NOT WORK:

	curl http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/jpred/downloads/jpredapi.tar.gz -o ./jredapi.tar.gz

	tar xzf jpredapi.tar.gz

Test using the following command:

	perl jpredapi submit mode=single format=raw email=name@domain.com name=TestJob1 seq=MQVWPIEGIKKFETLSYLPPLTVEDLLKQIEYLLRSKWVPCLEFSKVGFVYRENHRSPGYYDGRYWTMWKLPMFGCTDATQVLKELEEAKKAYPDAFVRIIGFDNVRQVQLISFIAYKPPGC

If this runs successfully, proceed to the following VERY IMPORTANT STEP (MUST DO IN ORDER):

	java -jar vkbat.jar [enter raw sequence here]

copy the jpredapi file from the JPred_API_client_v_1_5 into the newly created /files/predict/jpred directory then re-run the following command:

	java -jar vkbat.jar [enter raw sequence]

IMPORTANT NOTE: If the above did not properly set-up the files, please feel free to reach out via email at richard.pearson@sjsu.edu so I can help.
